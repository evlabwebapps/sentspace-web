            <h4>What is <i>SentSpace</i>?</h4>

            <i>SentSpace</i> is an open and easy-to-use tool for characterizing text using diverse features
            related to how humans process and understand language.

            <li> <i>SentSpace</i> is a modular, open-source framework for streamlined evaluation of text. </li>
            <li> <i>SentSpace</i> characterizes textual input using cognitively motivated lexical, syntactic, and semantic features computed at the token- as well as phrase- and sentence level. </li>
            <li> Features are derived from psycholinguistic experiments, large-scale corpora, and theoretically motivated models of language processing. </li>


            <br /> <br />
            <h4> What can I use <i>SentSpace</i> for? </h4>

            <i>SentSpace</i> allows for quantification and comparison of different types of text. Current
            research in fields such as natural language processing, cognitive science, neuroscience,
            artificial intelligence, and the social sciences relies on numerical representations of
            text for many purposes. <i>SentSpace</i> provides streamlined evaluation of textual input to
            yield useful numerical representations of words, phrases, and sentences.

            Examples of questions that can be answered using these <i>SentSpace</i> representations are:
            How does text generated by an artificial language model compare to that generated by
            humans? How do utterances produced by neurotypicals compare to those of individuals with
            communication disorders?

            <li><b>Text Generation/Dialog Systems</b>: <i>SentSpace</i> features of interest can be used to guide artificial
            systems to generate text that is more human-like and/or has certain desired properties.</li>
            <li><b>Experimental Sciences (Neuroscience, Cognitive Science)</b>: <i>SentSpace</i> can be used to evaluate the
            normativity of stimuli/datasets.</li>  
            <li><b>NLP/NLU</b>: high-dimensional vector embeddings from large pre-trained
            language models have revolutionized machine learning within the past few years. <i>SentSpace</i> can serve
            as a complementary resource that can provide interpretability and grounding to these widely used
            high-dimensional embeddings.</li>


            <br />

            <h4>What types of features does <i>SentSpace</i> provide?</h4>
    
            <i>SentSpace</i> focuses on interpretable and cognitively motivated linguistic features.
            These features have been shown to be relevant to language processing in humans.  The
            <i>SentSpace</i> features fall into two core modules (sentence spaces): Lexical and
            Contextual.

            The Lexical module operates on individual lexical items (words) within a sentence and computes a
            summary representation by combining information across the words in the sentence. This module
            includes features such as frequency, concreteness, age of acquisition, lexical decision latency,
            contextual diversity, etc.

            The Contextual module operates on sentences as whole and includes syntactic features,
            such as the depth of center embedding, and other features, like sentence-level
            sentiment.
            
            New modules can be easily added to <i>SentSpace</i> to provide additional ways to characterize
            text.  In this manner, <i>SentSpace</i> provides a quantitative and interpretable
            representation of any sentence.  For a full description of features currently supported
            by <i>SentSpace</i>, please navigate to the tab Feature Descriptions.

            <h4> How can I access <i>SentSpace</i>?  </h4>

            <i>SentSpace</i> is available as a Python package which can be accessed through a command line
            interface or imported as a module. We also provide a hosted front-end, where anyone can
            access <i>SentSpace</i> without any need for installation, compute or Python experience.  Please
            find a guide for how to use <i>SentSpace</i> under Usage.
