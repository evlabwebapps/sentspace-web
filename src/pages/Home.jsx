            <h5>Welcome to   <span style={{"fontFamily": "monospace"}}>  SentSpace</span>  !</h5>

              <span style={{"fontFamily": "monospace"}}>  SentSpace</span>   is an open and easy-to-use tool for characterizing text using diverse features related to how humans process and understand language.

            <br/> <br/>
            <p><h3>What is   <span style={{"fontFamily": "monospace"}}>  SentSpace</span>  ?</h3></p>
            <ul>
                <li>  <span style={{"fontFamily": "monospace"}}>  SentSpace</span>   is a modular, open-source framework for streamlined evaluation of text.</li>
                <li>  <span style={{"fontFamily": "monospace"}}>  SentSpace</span>   characterizes textual input using cognitively motivated lexical, syntactic, and semantic features computed at the token- as well as phrase- and sentence level.&nbsp;</li>
                <li>Features are derived from psycholinguistic experiments, large-scale corpora, and theoretically motivated models of language processing.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><h3>What can I use   <span style={{ "fontFamily": "monospace" }}>SentSpace</span>   for?</h3></p>
            <p>  <span style={{ "fontFamily": "monospace" }}>SentSpace</span>   allows for quantification and comparison of different types of text. Current research in fields such as natural language processing, cognitive science, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and the social sciences relies on numerical representations of text for many purposes.   <span style={{ "fontFamily": "monospace" }}>SentSpace</span>   provides streamlined evaluation of textual input to yield useful numerical representations of words, phrases, and sentences.</p>

            <p>Examples of questions that can be answered using   <span style={{"fontFamily": "monospace"}}>  SentSpace</span>   representations are:&nbsp;</p>
            <li><strong>Text Generation/Dialog Systems. </strong><em>How does text generated by artificial language models compare to that generated by humans?</em>
            <span style={{"fontFamily": "monospace"}}>  SentSpace</span>   features of interest can be used to compare text generated by artificial systems and humans. Moreover, these features can be used to guide artificial systems to generate text that is more human-like and/or has certain desired properties.</li>
            <li><strong>Language Model Grounding and Interpretability. </strong><em>What psycholinguistic information do high-dimensional vector representations from pre-trained language models capture?</em> <br/>
              <span style={{"fontFamily": "monospace"}}>  SentSpace</span>  features allow for interpretation of high-dimensional vector representations from large pre-trained language models.   <span style={{"fontFamily": "monospace"}}>  SentSpace</span>   serves as a complementary resource that can provide grounding to these widely used high-dimensional representations.</li>
            <li><strong>Experimental Sciences. </strong><em>How naturalistic is a set of experimental materials?</em>
              <span style={{"fontFamily": "monospace"}}>  SentSpace</span>   can be used to evaluate the normativity of experimental stimuli in experimental sciences such as neuroscience, cognitive science, and linguistics.</li>
            <li><strong>Analyzing Human Utterances</strong>. <em>How do utterances produced by different human populations differ from each other?</em>
              <span style={{"fontFamily": "monospace"}}>  SentSpace</span>   can help meaningfully quantify divergence in utterances produced by different human populations such as e.g. neurotypical individuals and individuals with communication disorders.&nbsp;</li>


            <br/><br/>
            <h3>What types of features does  <span style={{"fontFamily": "monospace"}}>  SentSpace</span>  provide?</h3> 
              <span style={{"fontFamily": "monospace"}}>  SentSpace</span>   focuses on interpretable and cognitively motivated linguistic features. These features have been shown to be relevant to language processing in humans.
            <br/>
            The   <span style={{"fontFamily": "monospace"}}>  SentSpace</span>   features fall into two core modules (<em>sentence spaces</em>): Lexical and Contextual.
            The Lexical module operates on individual lexical items (words) within a sentence and computes a summary representation by combining information across the words in the sentence. This module includes features such as frequency, concreteness, age of acquisition, lexical decision latency, contextual diversity, etc.
            The Contextual module operates on sentences as whole and includes syntactic features, such as the depth of center embedding, and other features, like sentence-level sentiment.
            New modules can be easily added to   <span style={{"fontFamily": "monospace"}}>  SentSpace</span>   to provide additional ways to characterize text.
            <p>In this manner,   <span style={{"fontFamily": "monospace"}}>  SentSpace</span>   provides a quantitative and interpretable
            representation of any sentence. For a full description of features currently supported
            by   <span style={{"fontFamily": "monospace"}}>  SentSpace</span>  , please navigate to the tab   <span style={{ "text-decoration": "underline" }}>Feature Descriptions</span>.</p>
            
            <br/><br/>
            <p><h3>How can I access  <span style={{"fontFamily": "monospace"}}>  SentSpace</span>  ?</h3></p>
            <p>  <span style={{"fontFamily": "monospace"}}>  SentSpace</span>  is available as a Python package which can be accessed through a command line interface or imported as a module. We also provide a hosted front-end, where anyone can access   <span style={{"fontFamily": "monospace"}}>  SentSpace</span>  without any need for installation, compute, or Python experience.</p>
            <p>Please find a guide for how to use   <span style={{"fontFamily": "monospace"}}>  SentSpace</span>   under   <span style={{ "text-decoration": "underline" }}>Usage</span>  .</p>
